# Stock-Market-Prediction
In this project, we'll predict the price of the S&P500 stock market index.
Stock market data can be interesting to analyze and as a further incentive, strong predictive models can have large financial payoff. The amount of financial data on the web is seemingly endless. A large and well structured dataset on a wide array of companies can be hard to come by. Here I provide a dataset with historical stock prices (last 5 years) for all companies currently found on the S&P 500 index.
The script I used to acquire all of these .csv files can be found in this GitHub repository In the future if you wish for a more up to date dataset, this can be used to acquire new versions of the .csv files.
